Alright bro, chill 😄
This question *looks* scary because of the word **convolution**, but the idea is actually **very simple**. I’ll explain it **slowly, intuitively, and exam-friendly** — exactly CSE 220 style.

---

## 1️⃣ What is actually happening here? (Big picture)

You have:

* **Stock prices** → this is your **input signal** `x[k]`
* **Exponential weights** → this is your **impulse response** `h[k]`
* **Output** → smoothed prices `y[n]`

👉 **Exponential smoothing = convolution of x[k] with h[k]**

So nothing magical. You are just:

> **Taking a weighted sum of the last `n` values, where recent values get more weight**

---

## 2️⃣ Convolution formula (core idea)

The convolution sum is:

[
y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k] \cdot h[n-k]
]

But **don’t panic** — in this problem:

* We only use **last `n` values**
* `h[k] = 0` outside the window
* So the sum becomes **finite and simple**

---

## 3️⃣ Define the two signals clearly (very important for marks)

### ✅ Input signal `x[k]`

This is just your **stock prices**.

Example:

```
x = [10, 11, 12, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18]
```

---

### ✅ Impulse response `h[k]`

Given in the problem:

[
h[k] = \alpha (1-\alpha)^k
]

For:

```
α = 0.8
n = 3
```

We only define:

```
h[0], h[1], h[2]
```

So:

```
h[0] = 0.8 × (0.2)^0 = 0.8
h[1] = 0.8 × (0.2)^1 = 0.16
h[2] = 0.8 × (0.2)^2 = 0.032
```

👉 **Most recent value gets h[0] (largest weight)**
👉 Older values get smaller weights

---

## 4️⃣ How convolution works here (sliding window intuition)

For **each output**, do this:

1. Take `n` consecutive prices
2. Reverse the window logic (recent → k = 0)
3. Multiply with weights
4. Add

That’s it.

---

## 5️⃣ First output step-by-step (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Window:

```
[10, 11, 12]
```

Most recent = **12**

[
y[0] =
0.8×12 + 0.16×11 + 0.032×10
]

[
= 9.6 + 1.76 + 0.32 = 11.68
]

✅ Matches sample output

---

## 6️⃣ Second output (to show sliding effect)

### Window:

```
[11, 12, 9]
```

Most recent = **9**

[
y[1] =
0.8×9 + 0.16×12 + 0.032×11
]

[
= 7.2 + 1.92 + 0.352 = 9.472 ≈ 9.47
]

---

## 7️⃣ How convolution formula matches this (exam gold 🥇)

Let:

* `x[k]` = stock prices
* `h[k]` = exponential weights

Then:

[
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x[n-k] \cdot h[k]
]

This is **exactly what you are computing**.

So when they say:

> *“You must use convolution”*

They mean:

> **Implement this weighted sum using the convolution definition — not library functions**

---

## 8️⃣ Why output size = `m − n + 1`?

Because:

* Window size = `n`
* Each output needs `n` values
* Sliding window across `m` values

Example:

```
10 prices, window = 3
→ 10 − 3 + 1 = 8 outputs
```

---

## 9️⃣ One-line intuition (remember this)

> **Exponential smoothing = convolution where recent samples matter more**

---

## 10️⃣ If you want, I can also:

* ✍️ Write the **Python logic (no library convolution)**
* 🧠 Show how this relates to **LTI systems**
* 📌 Explain how to reverse h[k] properly in convolution

Just tell me, bro 👊
